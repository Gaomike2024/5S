  <h1>5S on GitHub</h1>

  <h2>1. 5S Documentation and Templates</h2>
  <p>You can store text files containing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>5S guidelines:</strong> Document the 5S principles, their definitions, and implementation strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual aids:</strong> Include diagrams, flowcharts, or images explaining the 5S steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Checklists and templates:</strong> Create checklists for each 5S stage to ensure consistent implementation across different departments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Collaborative Development of 5S Resources</h2>
  <p>If your organization has an internal development team, you can use GitHub:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To store code for custom applications or tools</strong> related to 5S implementation, such as audit checklists or training materials.</li>
    <li><strong>To facilitate collaboration</strong> among developers working on these tools.</li>
    <li><strong>To track changes and maintain different versions</strong> of the code.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing Open-Source 5S Resources</h2>
  <p>If you've developed any open-source resources related to 5S, such as templates, scripts, or code for 5S-related applications, you can share them on GitHub.
  This allows the broader community to access, contribute to, and improve these resources.</p>
